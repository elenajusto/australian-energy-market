Exploring the nature and state of the Australian Energy Market with regards to the transition from Non-Renewable Energy sources to Renewable Energy Sources.


<h3>StateOfEnergyExploration.ipynb </h3>

This notebook visualises the sources of energy production (renewable vs non renewable sources) from the table provided by the
Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW).

<h3> HisotricalStationExploration.ipynb</h3>

This notebook aims to visualise the relationship between the number of accredited power stations under the Renewable Energy Target Act
from historical data provided by the Clean Energy Regulator between 2001 and 2022, in relation to the previous notebook's visualisation of
renewable energy power generation in Australia to see if there is a relation between the RET and actual change in energy production in 
Australia towards renewable sources.
